`yasdi2mqtt` is a MQTT adapter for SMA inverters communicating using the `yasdi` protocol, allowing for local or IP-based communication. It fetches spot values from attached devices in a fixed interval and publishes them as JSON via MQTT.

<details>
<summary>Full JSON Example</summary>

`yasdi2mqtt` will publish a JSON payload on the MQTT channel `$MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX/<device_sn>` in the given update interval. Messages will be sent for each inverter individually and have the following format:
```json
{"sn":000,"time":1586608779,"values": {
   "Iac":12580,
   "Uac":239,

## Wiring & Hardware
> Work in progress. If you have time to describe the hardware setup, feel free to contribute :)

## Setup & Run
Using the `:alpine` or `:latest` images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pkwagner/yasdi2mqtt), you'll get a fresh build every month. Therefore, I'd strongly encourage you choosing a container-based choice from below and taking care of updating the images regularly.

For simplicity, all examples below run `yasdi2mqtt` as container root. For production builds, consider creating an unprivileged user instead.

### Choice I: docker-compose
1. Check `yasdi.ini` configuration
    * The included blueprint is pre-configured for directly attached RS485 adapters. Usually, no work needs to be done here, as you'll define the adapter mapping in step 3.
    * If you want to use IP-based communication instead, you should have a look on the `yasdi` manual or check out [this discussion](https://github.com/pkwagner/yasdi2mqtt/issues/1) (German).
2. Create empty `devices` directory
    * Not necessary, but `yasdi` will use this folder as device data cache, so you'll save 1-2 minutes for device data download after the first startup.
3. Edit `docker-compose.yml` file
    * Check out the table below for the environment variable mapping (section `environment`).
    * You may adjust the serial adapter path (section `devices`, the part before the colon) if not mapped to `/dev/ttyUSB0` or drop it when using an IP-based setup.
4. `docker-compose up`
    * After starting up, `yasdi2mqtt` should immediately connect to your MQTT broker.
    * Detected devices should be printed on `stdout` quite quickly, but the the initial device data download may delay the first data for 1-2 minutes.

### Choice II: docker

3. Start container with the command below
    * Check out the table below for the environment variable mapping (`-e` flags).
    * You may adjust the serial adapter path (`--device` flag, the part before the colon) if not mapped to `/dev/ttyUSB0` or drop it when using an IP-based setup.
    * After starting up, `yasdi2mqtt` should immediately connect to your MQTT broker.
    * Detected devices should be printed on `stdout` quite quickly, but the the initial device data download may delay the first data for 1-2 minutes.

## Get Help
Thanks to a growing community of `yasdi2mqtt` users, there is already plenty of information on the [Discussions](https://github.com/pkwagner/yasdi2mqtt/discussions) tab. If you struggle during setup, please check out existing answers first or feel free to open a new thread. Here's a quick overview over some relevant threads:

* [RS485 wiring and adapter recommendations](https://github.com/pkwagner/yasdi2mqtt/discussions/6) (German)
* [IP-based setup](https://github.com/pkwagner/yasdi2mqtt/discussions/5) (German)
* [Integration with Home Assistant](https://github.com/pkwagner/yasdi2mqtt/discussions/18)

### Debugging
There are two options to make `yasdi2mqtt` more verbose:
* Enable the debug output of `yasdi2mqtt` using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable from the table above.
* Replace `YASDI_DEBUG_OUTPUT=0` by `YASDI_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1` in the `Dockerfile` to activate the debug output of the underlying `yasdi` library.
    * You'll need to re-compile your own container using `docker build -t yasdi2mqtt .` and change the `docker-compose.yml` file to use your own container.
    * When doing a manual setup, replace the parameter directly when installing `yasdi`.
